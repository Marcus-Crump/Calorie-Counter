# An application to take a given list of main ingredients in a dish and give a caloric break down and a total

# First, the user will create a TXT file **TODO Think about how/if it needs to be formatted and ways areounf this**

# The program will then take the file **TODO Where is the file located, how will it find the file**

# Then the program will tokenize the list of ingredients **TODO How will it do this with the formatting you will decide on**

# The program will loop through the tokens and make websearches using the google search formatting 

# Using BS4, the program will then pull the number from the search **TODO Are you sure all sample sizes are 100G**

# It will store this info in a list **TODO how will this work for portions, are you going to make mom calaculate it**

# Ideally, I want the program to take the measurements the user is putting in and figure out how many calories it has
